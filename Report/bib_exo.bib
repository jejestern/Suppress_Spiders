@article{Padmanabhan2017,
abstract = {We extend the results of previous analyses towards constraining the abundance and clustering of post-reionization (z ∼ 0-5) neutral hydrogen (H I) systems using a halo model framework. We work with a comprehensive HI data set including the small-scale clustering, column density and mass function of HI galaxies at low redshifts, intensity mapping measurements at intermediate redshifts and the ultraviolet/optical observations of Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) systems at higher redshifts. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to constrain the parameters of the best-fitting models, both for the HI-halo mass (HIHM) relation and the HI radial density profile. We find that a radial exponential profile results in a good fit to the low-redshift HI observations, including the clustering and the column density distribution. The form of the profile is also found to match the high-redshift DLA observations, when used in combination with a three-parameter HIHM relation and a redshift evolution in the HI concentration. The halo model predictions are in good agreement with the observed HI surface density profiles of low-redshift galaxies, and the general trends in the impact parameter and covering fraction observations of high-redshift DLAs. We provide convenient tables summarizing the best-fitting halo model predictions.},

abstract = {We review the analytical prescriptions in the literature to model the 21-cm (emission line surveys/intensity mapping experiments) and Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) observations of neutral hydrogen (H I) in the post-reionization universe. While these two sets of prescriptions have typically been applied separately for the two probes, we attempt to connect these approaches to explore the consequences for the distribution and evolution of H I across redshifts. We find that a physically motivated, 21-cm-based prescription, extended to account for the DLA observables provides a good fit to the majority of the available data, but cannot accommodate the recent measurement of the clustering of DLAs at z ∼ 2.3. This highlights a tension between the DLA bias and the 21-cm measurements, unless there is a very significant change in the nature of H I-bearing systems across redshifts 0-3. We discuss the implications of our findings for the characteristic host halo masses of the DLAs and the power spectrum of 21-cm intensity fluctuations.},

@article{Barnes2014,
abstract = {We discuss the recent Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey measurement of a rather high bias factor for the host galaxies/haloes of damped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs), in the context of our previous modelling of the physical properties of DLAs within the cold dark matter paradigm. Joint modelling of the column density distribution, the velocity width distribution of associated low-ionization metal absorption, and the bias parameter suggests that DLAs are hosted by galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range 10.5 {\textless} log M v {\textless} 13, with a rather sharp cutoff at the lower mass end, corresponding to virial velocities of ∼90 km s −1. The observed properties of DLAs appear to suggest very efficient (stellar) feedback in haloes with masses/virial velocities below the cutoff and a large retained baryon fraction (35 per cent) in haloes above the cutoff.},

@techreport{Bryan1998,
abstract = {We compare the results of Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations of cluster formation against virial scaling relations between four bulk quantities : the cluster mass, the dark matter velocity dispersion, the gas temperature, and the cluster luminosity. The comparison is made for a large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three di †erent cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and open cold dark matter). We Ðnd that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the Ðxed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, Ðnding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again Ðnding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the e †ect of metallicity with a Ðxed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a Ðrm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are brie{\~{N}}y discussed.},

@techreport{Newburgh2016,
abstract = {The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is a new 400-800 MHz radio interferometer under development for deployment in South Africa. HIRAX will comprise 1024 six meter parabolic dishes on a compact grid and will map most of the southern sky over the course of four years. HIRAX has two primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at high redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe unresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line ('hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at redshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). BAO are a preferential length scale in the matter distribution that can be used to characterize the expansion history of the Universe and thus understand the properties of Dark Energy. HIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by observing a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift range) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the universe transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a hydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing the sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern Hemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with large-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths. Daily maps of a few thousand square degrees of the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing much of the Milky Way galaxy, will also open new opportunities for discovering and monitoring radio transients. The HIRAX correlator will have the ability to rapidly and efficiently detect transient events. This new data will shed light on the poorly understood nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), enable pulsar monitoring to enhance long-wavelength gravitational wave searches, and provide a rich data set for new radio transient phenomena searches. This paper discusses the HIRAX instrument, science goals, and current status.},
