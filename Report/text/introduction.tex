\section{Introduction}

- Finding habitable planets is really interesting for scientist at the moment
- habitable planets are usually already older, and therefore cold C small, whereas young planets which are still contracting are still warm and so they are easier to detect directly 
-  With the current instruments we are yet not sensible enough to find a lot old planets -> only around really close and faint stars
